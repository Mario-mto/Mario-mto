## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Mario
## âš¡ WhoAmI
I'm a Python developer focused on **ML/AI** with a dual degree in **Health Tech** and **Engineering Physics**. I build clean, reproducible **imaging & data pipelines** (MRI with 3D Slicer, stats) and ship practical toolsâ€”sometimes full-stack (React/Node). Based in **MontrÃ©al ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦**.

- [**Brain Morphology vs Head Dimensions (MRI Pipeline)**](https://github.com/Mario-mto/Brain-Morphology-vs-Head-Dimensions-MRI-Pipeline-)
  *Python + 3D Slicer (RAS landmarks, bounding boxes) to improve measurement precision & reproducibility.*

- [**EEG Spindle Detection (Wavelets & Graphs)**](https://github.com/Mario-mto/EEG-Spindle-Detection-Wavelets-Graphs-)  
  *Multi-wavelet + graph-based modeling; MATLAB notebooks and figures.*

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  
- [ ] Shipping a small **full-stack app** (FastAPI Â· React Â· Django)
- [ ] **Instagram video automation** pipeline
**Tech focus:** Python, FastAPI, Celery, FFmpeg, OpenCV, Postgres, Redis, Docker, GitHub Actions, S3  
> Note: automation is implemented to comply with the **Instagram Platform Policy** (no scraping, API-first, proper rate-limits & auth).
